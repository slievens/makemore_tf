# makemore_tf

Repository containing some notebooks and Python scripts to go along with 
Andrej Karpathy's lecture series on YouTube: [Neural Networks: Zero To Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ).

In the lecture series Pytorch is used. Here, we try to recreate the notebooks using Tensorflow.

Also heavily inspired by [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore)
